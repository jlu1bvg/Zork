Whodunit is an open-world role-playing murder mystery game with heavy dialogue. The video game is shown in text and has a minimap. A drug-addicted, alcoholic detective investigates his best friend's murder. Players can switch rooms and move the detective to interact with highlighted NPCs and objects. Early in the game, they have a partner who acts as the protagonist's voice of professionalism which may help with dialogue. For example, our protagonist is friends with Brent Baldwin. 

Dialogue and minigames replace combat in the game. Minigames like poker and blackjack make up the game. In addition, the game has the Scale of Deeds feature that affects the dice role depending on where your meter is. For example, if you have done relatively good deeds throughout the game, you are more likely to succeed when rolling the die. On the other hand, if your meter is relatively low, meaning you have done some evil deeds throughout the game, your die has a lower chance of succeeding. But there is some information you can achieve when committing evil acts that are not privy to everyone.

Due to the Scale of Deeds, it can actually affect the game's outcome. Where the different choices you make affect the ending of the game.
