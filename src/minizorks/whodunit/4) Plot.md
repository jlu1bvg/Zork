# Plot

With a bad hangover and no memory of the previous night, the player character awakens in a filthy hotel room in Slomer. When he runs into his friend Brent Baldwin, he is told that Glenn Davies, their other friend, has died. Uncertainty surrounds the victim's demise, but preliminary examination of the scene suggests that he was the victim of a mob lynching. The detectives investigate the rest of the neighbourhood while assisting locals with a variety of tasks.

Frank and Brent find evidence linking the murder of the hanged man to the death of their dearly beloved friend "Glenn Davies". Brent reveals that the man who was hung was a drug addict Steve Malok, who passed away from an overdose.

The detectives then stumble upon a standoff between police and drug dealers. Frank is hurt during a firefight and is unconscious for several days as a result. In the incident, most or all of the mercenaries are killed, and Brent was hospitalised.

The investigators(Frank and Brent) search a wreckage and discover Brent Baldwin isÂ the killer. It's up to you to choose wisely because Brent hasn't yet realised that Frank is aware that he killed Glenn.
