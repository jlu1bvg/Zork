# Whodunit

The text-based Murder Mystery game Whodunit was created by Owen Chen, Omer Hussein, Cyrus Abhary, and Weicheng Pan. The game was written by Owen Chen and designed by Cyrus Abhary, Omer Hussein, and Owen Chen.

Whodunit takes place in a fictional city's seaside area, which is still recovering from a bombing that occurred decades before the start of the game. Players take on the role of an alcoholic detective, solving a murder investigation. He begins to remember details of what transpired the night before and the current forces attempting to influence the city of Slovakia as the investigation progresses. Parallel was created for the most outstanding teacher, "Mr. Deslauries."

Parallel's unconventional murder mystery game has little to no actual combat. Instead, events are resolved through dialogue and minigames, such as poker and blackjack. Another addition is the Scale of Deeds; depending on the actions throughout the game, your final outcome is decided from the meter. This scale also has the addition of luck, where the die will be rolled to dictate the result of significant action in the game. The game is based on the Text-Based game "Zork."

Thank you for reading, and I hope we give you the experience of a lifetime!
