# Setting

Cyrus Abhary's Slovoke, with over 100 rooms and areas, is the setting for Parallel. 1984's game. Parallel consists of Islands, masses of land and sea separated by the Pale, an inscrutable, mist-like "connective tissue" (thanks, Ms. Landau) where reality breaks down. Aerostatic travel through the Pale, which can cause mental instability and death, is heavily regulated.

The game takes place in Slomer, an impoverished district of Slovoke on the central Island of Slomer, which was bombed 49 years prior.
